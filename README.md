3)Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
#Document your planning  
 Designing Android Studio and showing all the features that the user wants to use in the application 
 by coding fragments and layouts to do the application, and then I transfer the design to Figma. 
# A story about your development process 
 my development story is being more patience and it takes me less time than before  to figure out the errors 
# problem solving strategy 
 my problem strategies to solve the errors by google searching, material design website, Mr. Mohamed, 
 Mr.Saad, medium website.
