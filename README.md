 # user stories
  - As a user, I want to add the task to my application so that I can remember it later.
  - As a user, I want to edit my task each time so that I can make an update to the current task.
  - As a user, I want to delete my task so that I can remove my completed task. 
  - As a user, I want my application to show me the due date, so that I can remember to do the task in the due date. 
  - As a user, I want in my application to check if I complete it my task so I can do another task. 
  - As a user, I want to see in my HomeScreen ( Task, dueDate , completed or uncompleted) so that it can be easier to me to use.
  - As a user, I want to see the dueDate under the taskTitle so that I can do it on it's time. 
  - As a user, I want to use this application everyday so that I can organize my tasks that I would do each day 
# Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy. 
  - OutLine my plan: 
  - Designing Android Studio
  - Writing Codes 
  - Figma 
  - My development process and problem solving strategy is starting the design in Android Studio by using
 fragment XML, and writing the code and when I face a problem I search in google to find a solution to
 my errors and finding interesting websites as Material Design website, and learning to be more patience 
 and it takes me less time than before to figure out the errors. 
 Another problem solving strategy is Mr.Mohamed, Mr.Saad, and classmate Ghadeer 
# List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
 - filtering 
 - sorting 
 - notification if the task is completed or uncompleted 
 - using another database not just the local database that we used 
# Describe how some of your favorite functions work
 - learning "Material Card View" it give the design more flexibility to work with and change it's shape, color, stroke.....ets
 - learning how to use codes from "Material Design website" and put it in my code without errors
